## Navigate the file system

#### Change bash's current working directory
```bash
cd <file path here>
# to go up a directory from your current directory
cd ..
```

#### List a directory's contents
```bash
ls
# for more details, add -l (long)
ls -l
# this will output something like this:
# -rw-r--r--  1 cameronnokes  staff  1237 Jun  2 22:46 index.js
# in order, those columns are:
#   permissions for you, your group, all
#   number of links (hardlinks & softlinks)
#   owner user
#   owner group
#   file size
#   last modified time
#   file name

# to see hidden files/folders (like .git or .npmignore)
ls -a
# Note, flags can be combined like so
ls -la
```

## View files and folders in bash

#### Output a file to the screen (stdout)
```bash
cat <file name>
# shows it with line numbers
cat -n <file name>
```

#### View a file in bash
```bash
# view the file without dumping it all onto your screen
less <file name>
# Some useful shortcuts in less
#   Shift+g   (jump to end)
#   g         (go back to top)
#   /         (search)
#   q         (quit/close)
```

#### View file/folder in default application associated with it
```bash
open <file/folder name>
# view current directory in Finder
open .
# specify an application to use
open -a TextEdit <file name>
```

## Create and delete files and folders

#### Create a file
```bash
touch <file name>
```

#### Set or append to a file
```bash
# set the file's contents
echo 'hi' > file.txt
# append to file's contents
echo 'hi' >> file.txt
# note that if you pass a file name that doesn't exist, it'll get created on the fly
```

#### Create a directory
```bash
mkdir <folder name>
# make intermediary directories as needed
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild
```

#### Remove a file
```bash
# Note, this permanently deletes a file
rm <file name>
# Remove a folder and it's contents, recursively
rm -rf <folder name>
```


## Move and Copy Files and Folders with bash

#### Move a file
```bash
mv <target> <destination>
# for example, to rename a file
mv a.js b.js
# move all files in a folder to another folder
mv lib/* src
```

#### Copy a file
```bash
cp <target> <destination>
# copy everything recursively from one folder to another
cp -R src/* lib
```

## Find Files and Folders with `find` in bash
```bash
# find all the PNGs in a folder
find <path> -name "*.png"
# find all the JPGs (case insensitive) in a folder
find <path> -iname "*.jpg"
# find only directories
find <path> -type d
# delete all matching files
find <path> -name "*.built.js" -delete
# execute an arbitrary action on each match
# remember `{}` will be replaced with the file name
find <path> -name "*.png" -exec pngquant {} \;
```

## Search for text with `grep`

```bash
# Basic usage
grep <pattern> <target file or glob>
# Useful flags
# --color     (colorizes matches)
# -n          (show line numbers)
# -C <number> (show N lines above/below match for context)
# -e          (regex search)
```

## Make HTTP requests in bash with `curl`
The test server is available in the `curl-practice-server` directory. Run `npm install && npm start` to run it.
```bash
curl <url>
# Useful flags
# -i    (show response headers only)
# -L    (follow redirects)
# -H    (header flag)
# -X    (set HTTP method)
# -d    (request body)
# -o    (output to a file)

# to POST JSON
# (technically you don't need -X POST because -d will make it POST automatically, but I like to be explicit)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "title": "Curling" }' http://localhost:3000/api/posts

# POST a url encoded form
curl -X POST --data-urlencode title="Curling again" http://localhost:3000/api/posts

# multiline curl (applies to any bash command)
curl -i -X PUT \
-d '{ "title": "Changed title" }' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:3000/api/posts

# pretty print JSON with jsome
cur /1/ | jsome
```

Here's the [jsome ge/jsome) package that pretty prints JSON

## Create and run bash scripts

```bash
echo 'echo Hello World' > script.sh
chmod u+x script.sh
./script.sh
```
The `init-js.sh` script for scaffolding a JS project
```bash
echo "Initializing JS project at $(pwd)"
git init
npm init -y # create package.json with all the defaults
mkdir src
touch index.js
code .
```

One way to add that script to your `$PATH`:
```bash
cp init-js.sh /usr/local/bin/init-js
```

## Store and Use Values with bash Variables
```bash
# no spaces between name, =, and value
var=123
echo $var
# to make it accessible to all child processes of current shell, export it
export var
# this deletes the variable
unset var
```
To see all environment variables
```bash
env
```
`clone-to-temp.sh` script:
```bash
temp=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --branch $1 $PWD $temp
echo "branch $1 cloned to $temp"
# run some tasks, tests, etc here
```

## Understand and use functions in bash

```bash
greet() {
  echo "$1 world"
}

greeting=$(greet "howdy")

echo "the greeting is $greeting"
```

```bash
global=123

test() {
  echo "global = $global"
  local local_var="i'm a local"
  echo "local_var = $local_var"
}

test

echo "global = $global"
echo "local_var = $local_var" # will be empty because it's out of scope
```

## Understand exit statuses in bash

Get the last run command's exit status
```bash
ls
# will be 0 if it ran successfully, 1 - 255 for an error
echo $?
```
Exit statuses and functions. `script.sh`
```bash
ok() {
  return 0
}

fail() {
  return 1
}

fail
ok
```

```bash
./script.sh
echo $? # exit status is same as the last run function/command
```

## Use Conditional Statements in bash

Basic form
```bash
# Some conditional primaries that can be used in the if expression:
#   =, !=      string (in)equality
#   -eq, -ne   numeric (in)equality
#   -lt, -gt   less/greater than
#   -z         check variable is not set
#   -e         check file/folder exists

if [[ $USER = 'cameronnokes' ]]; then
  echo "true"
else
  echo "false"
fi
```

Conditionals can be used inline in a more ternary-like format
```bash
[[ $USER = 'cameronnokes' ]] && echo "yes" || echo "no"
```

`check-status.sh` for checking a URL is responding with a 200
```bash
check_status() {
  local status=$(curl -ILs $1 | head -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
  if [[ $status -lt 200 ]] || [[ $status -gt 299 ]]; then
    echo "$1 failed with a $status"
    return 1
  else
    echo "$1 succeeded with a $status"
  fi
}

check_statu tatu

## [Chain Commands with Pipes and Redirect Output in bash bash-chain-commands-with-pipes-and-redirect-output-in-bash)

Pipes
```bash
# ps ax will list all running processes
ps ax | grep Chrome | less
# get the file size after uglify + gzip
uglifyjs -c -m -- index.js | gzip -9 | wc -c
```

Redirection
```bash
# redirect stdout to a file
ls > ls.txt
# append stdout to a file
echo "hi" >> ls.txt
```
